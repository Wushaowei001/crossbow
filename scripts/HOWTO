Scripts

  run_crossbow
  run_iprover
  run_mace4
  run_paradox
  check_crossbow_models_with_paradox

use cgroup /crossbow-prover in cpuacct controller and memory controller.
They need permission to create subgroups and set controller parameters.

If the above scripts are executed under a user [user] run

  sudo ./create_cgroup [user]

to create the cgroup. The cgroup can be removed by running

  sudo ./delete_cgroup

The above scripts use commands

  cgcreate
  cgdelete
  cgget
  cgset
  cgexec

and access following files

  cpuacct.usage
  memory.swappiness
  memory.failcnt
  memory.limit_in_bytes
  memory.usage_in_bytes
  memory.max_usage_in_bytes
  memory.memsw.failcnt
  memory.memsw.limit_in_bytes
  memory.memsw.usage_in_bytes
  memory.memsw.max_usage_in_bytes
  tasks

so CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP (Memory Resource Controller Swap Extension)
must be active - this can be achieved by booting with kernel parameter

  swapaccount=1

Since file tasks cannot be accessed by cgget it's accessed directly
in a subdirectory of /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuacct/crossbow-prover/
and of /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/crossbow-prover/.

Note: On some older kernels it isn't possible to set memory.swappiness=0
and so the scripts won't work. It is known that this works on kernel 3.19.3.
