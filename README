Crossbow is a finite model finder for first-order logic.


How to compile
--------------

You'll need OCaml 4.02.2, GNU Make and GCC (GCC version 4.8.1
is known to work). Then you'll need following OCaml programs and libraries:

  batteries.2.3.1
  cmdliner.0.9.7
  menhir.20141215  (for tptp.0.3.1)
  ocamlfind.1.5.5
  oclock.0.4.0
  omake.0.9.8.6-0.rc1
  ounit.2.0.0  (optional for tests)
  pprint.20140424  (for tptp.0.3.1)
  ppx_tools.0.99.2
  sexplib.112.24.01
  sqlite3.2.0.9
  tptp.0.3.1
  zarith.1.3

When compiling sqlite3.2.0.9 and zarith.1.3 you'll need
SQLite 3 and the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library
installed with development files.
In openSUSE 13.1 you can install them by installing packages

  sqlite3-devel
  gmp-devel

Additionally to compile Crossbow you'll need zlib header file
(used by MiniSat).
In openSUSE 13.1 you can install it by installing package

  zlib-devel

When all dependencies are installed you can compile Crossbow by

  make

This builds program, scripts and API documentation. If ounit.2.0.0
is installed, you can compile and run tests by

  make check
